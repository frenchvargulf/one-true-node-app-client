Realtime painting only works with server running locally, so in order to draw with a friend using my app it needs to be installed locally. 
Please download a zip package and use npm i and then node server.js and npm start. And Have fun!

## Running the app

To run the application on your machine:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Open it in your IDE.
    Run npm i.
    Then run node server.js.
    Then npm start.

Please make sure you have CORS extension installed on your browser, although the headers on the server I wrote should take care of that issue. 

For full compatibilty please use Chrome.
